    <h1>Which Programming Language Should I learn?</h1>


    <p>Are you interested in computer programming?</p>
    <!-- make true or false survey, yes/no, if no = "should not program". -->

    <p>How do you feel about sitting in front of a computer for 8 hours a day, everyday?</p>
    <!-- make true or false survey, yes/no, if no = "should not program". -->

<p>Designing the aesthetics and layout of a website: </p>
- really interests me; I enjoy being creative is this aspect.
- is daunting, I don't have a creative bone in my body.
- is interesting, but I'd rather work behind the scenes.

<p>Working at established businesses or large corporations:</p>
- Is my ideal environment!
- I'd prefer to work at a smaller business, possibly a startup.
- I don't care, as long as I can participate in creating the user interface.

<p>Which of these best decribe you?</p>
- I prefer using a Windows computer, and wouldn't mind selling my soul to Microsoft.
- I'd really like to create websites the AirBnB, Scribd, and Twitter.
- If I can focus on the layout, colors, design, etc., I'll be happy.
