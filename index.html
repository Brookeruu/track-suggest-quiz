<p>Designing the aesthetics and layout of a website: </p>
- really interests me; I enjoy being creative is this aspect.
- is daunting, I don't have a creative bone in my body.
- is interesting, but I'd rather work behind the scenes.

<p>Working at established businesses or large corporations:</p>
- Is my ideal environment!
- I'd prefer to work at a smaller business, possibly a startup.
- I don't care, as long as I can participate in creating the user interface.

<p>Which of these best decribe you?</p>
- I prefer using a Windows computer, and wouldn't mind selling my soul to Microsoft.
- I'd really like to create websites the AirBnB, Scribd, and Twitter.
- If I can focus on the layout, colors, design, etc., I'll be happy.

<div class="resultRuby">
  <h3>Ruby</h3>
  <p>Ruby is a favorite language of developers building interactive web applications. If an app involves users creating accounts, entering information, and interacting with dynamic content, there's a good chance it is built with Ruby. Ruby became popular because the Rails framework, which is written with Ruby, simplified many of the common tasks associated with building web applications. It's most popular with startups and smaller companies who are looking to build their product quickly.</p>

<div class="resultCsharp">
  <h3>C#</h3>
  <p>C# is most popular among bigger established businesses, often for building internal software. Because it's been around for a long time and has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the most in-demand languages in the job market. C# has also been going through a bit of a rebirth lately, with Microsoft open sourcing the language and surrounding platform, porting it to run on Mac and Linux, and incorporating many of the best features of other languages. If you like the idea of working for a larger company on business software, C# is a great choice.</p>
